# Welcome to My Website

This site is a work in progress, built with the [Just the Docs](https://just-the-docs.com/) theme. I'm using it as a central place to organize and share my personal lists, guides, and other resources.

🚧 **Under Construction**  
The current version is a basic foundation — there’s much more to come! Over time, this site will evolve into a more comprehensive and organized collection of useful content.

## What to Expect

Here’s a preview of what I plan to include:

- ✅ Curated guides on how to tackle various computer problems 
- 🔗 Useful resources and programs
- ❓ And perhaps more in the future

Stay tuned!
