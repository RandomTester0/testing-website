> ⚠️ **You may have seen a bunch of information on YouTube and elsewhere about how to 'make Windows faster'. Unfortunately, most of these solutions, such as disabling Windows Defender, messing with Windows services, uninstalling system components, and running 'optimisation' tools, are plain awful.** Here are some basic tricks to keep your Windows in good condition.

# 🔥 Simple Tricks to Improve Performance

## 1. Delete unused apps

Just go to **Settings** and search for **Apps**. People often forget about random apps they have lying around, as well as pre-installed garbage. Delete these to free up space and perhaps gain some performance.

## 2. Check your startup apps

Open **Task Manager** by pressing **Ctrl + Shift + Esc** or by searching for it in the Start menu. Go to the **Startup** tab, then simply check if there are any apps you don't need running right when your computer starts. Disable these to stop unnecessary programs from running in the background.

## 3. Run Disk Cleanup

Press the **Windows key + R** to open the Run dialog, type **"cleanmgr"**, and press Enter. Select which types of files to delete, and let the program clean your system.
> On that note, try to use in-built Windows utility software to maintain your computer, instead of third-party alternatives such as CCleaner, etc.

## 4. Check for malware and bloatware

Run a full scan with **Windows Defender** or your preferred antivirus software. Malware and bloatware can severely impact system performance. Make sure your system is clean.
> Tip: I recommend using only Windows Defender, it's pretty good now and in fact better than some alternatives. If you must use another one, try to stick to something good like Malwarebytes, avoid companies like Norton, McAfee and Avast, and never have more than 1 **extra* antivirus installed.


## 5. Check for Windows Updates

Ensure that your system is up-to-date with the latest patches and fixes. Go to **Settings > Update & Security > Windows Update**, and click on **Check for updates**. Some updates can help improve system stability and performance.

## 6. Update Your Graphics Drivers

Graphics drivers are crucial for ensuring that your system performs well, especially with modern games and demanding applications. Outdated / incompatible drivers may be losing you performance, especially for newly released games if they are not required altogether.

## 6. Defragment and Optimize Drives

For **[ONLY!!!]** HDDs (not SSDs), go to **Settings > System > Storage**, and under **Optimise Drives**, select your hard drive and click **Optimise**. This will rearrange fragmented data to be contigious for faster access, improving system performance.
> I repeat, DON'T DO THIS ON SSD'S! No performance benefit and you will ruin the lifespan of your drive! Badly written software like Norton 360 will attempt to do this: another reason to avoid it.


## 7. Reboot your computer

Especially since Windows introduced "Fast Startup", a simple reboot can often solve various problems that shutting down and powering on won't.

# Now for some optional steps that *could* boost performance, but come with certain drawbacks:

## Disable unnecessary visual effects

Windows comes with a lot of visual effects that may look pretty but can slow down performance for less powerful systems. To turn them off, right-click on **This PC**, select **Properties**, and click on **Advanced system settings**. In the **Performance** section, click **Settings**. From here, you can either choose **Adjust for best performance** or manually disable effects. Be warned that this **will** make the OS look worse.

## Adjust Power Settings

You may want to make your power settings configured for performance rather than power saving. Go to **Control Panel > Power Options**, and select **High performance** (or search up how to get the "Ultimat Performance" mode) I wouldn't recommend this for laptops though, unless you constantly are on charge.

## Clean install Windows

Clean installing Windows will remove all bloatware on the system, making it much cleaner and the easiest way to clear out old things that are degrading performance. However, reinstalling drivers and programs, as well as backing up files may be a hassle.

By following these basic steps, you may be able to make improvements your system’s performance without resorting to risky tweaks or third-party "optimization" tools.
